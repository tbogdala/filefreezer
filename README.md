Filefreezer (Development 0.9.X)
======================

[![Development Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tbogdala/filefreezer.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/tbogdala/filefreezer)

A simple to deploy cloud file storage multi-user system; Licensed under the GPL v3.

Have you ever wanted an easy to deploy server for backing up files and
storing them encrypted on a remote machine? Filefreezer does that! It 
also keeps versions of the files that have been added to the server so that
you can go back in the file history and pull up old versions of the files.

Alpha 1 is the first public release of the project. It's passing all of the projects
unit tests. Please try it out and report any bugs or any instabilities you find. 
A GUI front end is under development and a web front end will follow shortly after.

**Because it is an alpha release, please don't trust it for reliability yet!**

Features
--------

* Zero-knowledge encryption of file data and file name; the server
  does not store the user's cryptography password and cannot decrypt
  any of the data the client sends.

* File versioning

* Multi-user capability with quota restrictions

* Simple data storage backend using Sqlite3

* Public RESTful API that can be used by other clients

**ALPHA RELEASE: API AND DATABASE STABILITY NOT GUARANTEED!**


Installation
------------

The quick way to install Filefreezer is to use `go get` to download
the repository and its dependences and then `go install` to install
the `freezer` CLI executable to $GOROOT/bin.

```bash
go get github.com/tbogdala/filefreezer/...
go install github.com/tbogdala/filefreezer/cmd/freezer
```
---

Another way to quickly deploy Filefreezer is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and pull
the current image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tbogdala/filefreezer/)

```bash
sudo docker pull tbogdala/filefreezer:0.9.0
sudo docker run --rm -v $HOME/freezer:/data tbogdala/filefreezer:0.9.0 user add -u admin -p 1234
sudo docker run --read-only --rm -v $HOME/freezer:/data -p 8040:8080 tbogdala/filefreezer:0.9.0
```

For more information, see the page on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tbogdala/filefreezer/).

To serve HTTPS with self-signed TLS keys for development purposes, the necessary files
can be generated with openssl using the certgen tool from the Go source code:

```bash
cd cmd/freezer/certgen
go run generate_cert.go -ca -ecdsa-curve P384 -host 127.0.0.1
mv cert.pem ../freezer.crt
mv key.pem ../freezer.key
```

In production you will want to use your own valid certificate public and private keys
for serving HTTPS.


Quick Start (work in progress)
------------------------------

Before running the server you must create users for the system or else
no one will be able to authenticate and sync files. The act of adding
a user will also create the database file that will be used later
when running the server.

To setup a user named `admin` with a password of `1234` run the following command:

```bash
freezer user add -u admin -p 1234
```

If you wanted to remove this user, user the following command:

```bash
freezer user rm -u admin
```

At any point you can modify the user information like name, password 
and quota using the `freezer user mod` command. For example you 
can change the quota of the admin user to 1 KB by running the
following command:

```bash
freezer user mod -u admin --quota 1024
```

Once a user has been added to the storage database you can launch
the server listening on port 8080 by running the following command:

```bash
freezer serve ":8080"
```

With the server running you can now check the user's stats with
this command:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -h localhost:8080 user stats
```

Before uploading files the client needs to specify a cryptography password
so that all file names and data are encrypted on the client's machine and
only the client has knowledge of this crypto password (unlike the login
password, which can be setup by the service administrator separately).

To set the cryptography password for a client, run the following
which will set the crypto pass to `secret`:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -h localhost:8080 user cryptopass secret
```

Since the file names are encrypted as well as the file data, the crypto
password has to be setup before you can see the list of files the user
has synchronized with the server. 

To get the list of files stored by the user, run the following:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -h localhost:8080 file ls
```

A file can be syncrhonized with the server by running the following command,
which for test purposes will upload a file called `hello.txt` from the user's
home directory:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -s secret -h localhost:8080 sync ~/hello.txt hello.txt
```

The first parameter to the `sync` command is the local filepath to syncrhonize.
A second parameter can be specified to override what the file would be called
on the server. If only `~/hello.txt` was specified, it will get expanded and 
named on the server as `/home/timothy/hello.txt` (depending on the user's home
directory). By providing the second parameter of `hello.txt` it will now be
known as only `hello.txt` on the server.

If at some point you want to remove this file, you can do so with the 
following command:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -h localhost:8080 file rm hello.txt
```

Notice that the command takes the name of the file on the server and not
the local file which was originally specified on the command line.

If you wanted to remove a set of files controlled by a regular expression,
you can use the `--regex` flag like so:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -h localhost:8080 file rm --regex --dryrun "h*"
```

The regular expression will likely have to be supplied in a quoted string to
avoid the shell from evaluating wildcards. The `--dryrun` flag means freezer
will output the filenames matched as if it was going to remove it, but no
file deletion will actually happen. Remove the flag to actually remove the 
matched files.

If you make a change to the `~/hello.txt` file and sync again it will upload
a new version of that file to the server.

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -s secret -h localhost:8080 sync ~/hello.txt hello.txt
```

You can get a list of stored versions on the server for a given file by
running the following command:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -s secret -h localhost:8080 versions ls hello.txt
```

If you wanted only to see the content of `hello.txt` you can use the following
command to print the unencrypted version of it:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -s secret -h localhost:8080 file cat hello.txt
```

If you wanted to syncronize the local file back to the first version of the
file, you can do so with the following command which will overrite the local
file with the original version of the file still stored on the server:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -s secret -h localhost:8080 sync --syncver=1 ~/hello.txt hello.txt
```

The local file should now be set back to what it was when it was originally synchronzied.

A shortcut to synchronize an entire directory is this command:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -s secret -h localhost:8080 syncdir /etc serverbackup/etc
```

This will upload the entire `/etc` folder and all of its subfolders to the server
under a prefix of `serverbackup`. By using a prefix like this in the target of
a `sync` or `syncdir` operation, you can logically organize different groups of files.

If you needed to remove old versions of a file, you can do so by specifying an
inclusive range in this command:

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -s secret -h localhost:8080 versions rm 1 2 hello.txt
```

This deletes the first and second version of the synced `hello.txt` file but leaves
other versions on the server.

If you wished to remove all of the file versions except the current one, you can
use this syntax where `H~` gets interpreted as (Current Version - 1):

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -s secret -h localhost:8080 versions rm 1 H~ hello.txt
```

You can also use the regular expression matching to remove all but the current
version of all files in storage by running the following command (thereby
saving some space):

```bash
freezer -u admin -p 1234 -s secret -h localhost:8080 versions rm 1 H~ --regex ".*"
```


Testing and Benchmarking
------------------------

This package ships with unit tests and benchmarks included. These are in separate
locations to have the tests isolated to the main `filefreezer` package and then
tests specific to the projects located in the `cmd` directory.

Currently to run all of the tests you would execute the following in a shell:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tbogdala/filefreezer/tests
go test
cd ../cmd/freezer
go test
```

To run the benchmarks you can execute a similar set of commands which will
only run the benchmarks and not the unit tests:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tbogdala/filefreezer/tests
go test -run=xxx -bench=.
cd ../cmd/freezer
go test -run=xxx -bench=.
```


Known Bugs and Limitations
--------------------------

* Consider a quota for max fileinfo registered so service cannot be DDOS'd 
  by registering infinite files.

* Incrementing a user's revision number only happens in some areas like chunk modification.
  Consider bumping the revision with new files are added or otherwise changed too.

* userid is taken on some Storage methods, but not all, for checking correct user is accessing data

* starting a remote sync target name with '/' in win32/msys2 attempts to autocomplete
  the string as a path and not give the desired results. the fix is to use cmd.exe to 
  perform the command line execution to get the desired results.


TODO / Notes
------------

* Inspired from a blog post about Dropbox:
  https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2014/07/streaming-file-synchronization/

* flag: file hashing algo

* flag: hash on start instead of just checking mod time

* flag: safetey level for database -- currently it is tuned to be very safe,
  but a non-zero chance of db corruption on power loss or crash. docs for
  sqlite say "in practice, you are more likely to suffer a catastrophic disk failure 
  or some other unrecoverable hardware fault" but this should be tunable
  via command line.

* work on readability of error messages wrt bubbling up error objects

* break up unit test functions into more modular test functions

* multithreading the chunk uploading of files

* review current code documentation for godoc purposes

* something like a general db stats command to return total files,
  chunks, versions per user/system

* remove output from cmd/freezer/command functions so that they
  are more reusable
